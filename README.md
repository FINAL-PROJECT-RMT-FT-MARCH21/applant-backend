Applant is our React Full-Stack project for the final module at the Ironhack's Web Dev Bootcamp. We built it only for desktop, and still working on making it available for mobile or tablet. We've used mainly ReactJs and many backend npm packages and modules but in resume: Axios to connect with our backend's API; NodeJS and ExpressJs for the routes and server of our API; Passport and BcryptJs for authentication, Stripe for the payments and MongoDB for the data base. For the front we've used ReactJs and SASS for the customization. 

Applant is a two part website that gathers information and curiosities and also gives access to an e-commerce about plants. It has two main roles, seller and customer. The seller has an admin role and it can create new items for the shop, edit it, create new posts at the curiosities blog space and create and delete users. In the other hand, the customer can navigate through all the items to see the detailed information, add it to favorites and purchase it. Also you have free access to see all the curiosities and items information without creating an user.🌱

As we said, at the moment it is not available for mobile phones. We will soon come back with the mobile version.
